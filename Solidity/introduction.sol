/*
Functional: Solidity language is used for smart contracts. 
            This mostly takes care of money-related needs (such as auctions, crowdfunding, or wallets with a multi-signature feature). 
            However, you can create other decentralized applications too (say, for voting).
Promising: the world spends billions on blockchain solutions every year.
           While most of it comes from financial companies, all kinds of businesses use Blockchain. 
           That puts skilled Solidity developers in extremely high demand.
Flexible:  you can use a Remix online compiler or download a command-line compiler on your PC to write smart contracts. 
            Both of these options are absolutely free.
Improving: Solidity language updates, such as new features and bug fixes, are introduced constantly.
